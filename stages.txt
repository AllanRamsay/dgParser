Parse sentences from the BNC using the given tags: for VVX-NNX, use
VVX (but we will want to recognise that VVG can be a gerund), for
VVD-VVN use VVD, but again recognise that VVD can be past tense or
past part.

Do this for lots of sentences, with a limit of say 500 for edges:
collect largest compact sentence, collect transitivity information.

Redo it, but using the transitivity info as a guide. Do this
probabilistically. Probably have to do something sensible with probs:
geometric average?
