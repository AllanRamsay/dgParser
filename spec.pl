/**
  We have two features: specified and unspecified.

  Ther are four possible states:

  (i) We know it is specified
  (ii) We know it is not specifiefd
  (iii) We want it to be specified
  (iv) We want it to be not specified

  Should be able to do that with one feature. The problem is things like
  "old men", where "men" has to be -specified, because adjectives can
  only modify things that are not specified; but it has to be +specified,
  because it has to be able to be an argument.

  OK: when the target of a noun modifer is +used, check that its value for
  specified is not +.
