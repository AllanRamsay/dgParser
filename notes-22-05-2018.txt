Most: the reason why "most" was coming out as "*universal" was that I
hadn't said what its value for specifier was, and then you had a
(possibly accidental) default that determiners that don't have a value
for specifier are universals. So I fixed that in determiners.pl.

Polarity:

We wanted to switch polarity marking into the lexicon, rather than
having a table of words with polarity marks, because if you've got
information that is associated with individual words you should
include it in your description of individual words, i.e. in the
lexicon.

We start by adding a new feature, polarity, to the main signature, and
then we include it in the descriptions of words that need it (it will
default to 1 if we don't say anything).

word('doubt', X) :-
    language@X -- english,
    X <> [vroot, regularPast],
    S <> [tensedForm],
    sverb(X, S),
    args@X -- [COMP, _SUBJ],
    polarity@COMP -- -1.

every(X) :-
    X <> [det(10), thirdSing, simpleDet1(10), theta(specifier)],
    result@X <> [np, -target, specifier(*universal)],
    polarity@target@X -- -1.

Then every subtree of our main dependency tree will be marked by a
polarity, appearing as something like [love,{dobj, #13(A)}, {subject,A}]?1. 

We have to be a bit careful in the various steps in nf.pl to ignore
the polarity markers until we actually want to do something with them,
but apart from that I think it all comes out OK. At the points in the
parser where I add the polarity markers I assume that the default
value is 1 so we don't have to say anything unless we want to
explicitly add a negative marker.

So "every man loves some woman" comes out as 

({[(man>singular)?-1]?1,A}
  => ({[tense(present)],#23(A)}
       & ({(simple,#23(A)),#24(A)}
           & ({[(woman>singular)?1]?1,#25(A)}
               & ({(member,#24(A)),B}
                   => [([love, {dobj,#25(A)}, {subject,A}]?1),
                       B])))))

"most men love some woman" gets stuck at

qlf(qq(claim,
       qq([time(tense(A), aspect(B), aux(-), def(C), finite(tensed))],
          ([love,
            qq(indefinite::{[woman?1]?1,D},
               {dobj,D}),
            qq(most::{[(man>plural)?0]?1,E},
               {subject,E})]
            ? 1))))

Probably because we aren't doing anything with "most" in qff. But you
can see that the polarity marking on "man" is 0?1, which is what we want.

Are we getting the marking right? It may get clearer if we brutally simplify

({[(man>singular)?-1]?1,A}
  => ({[tense(present)],#23(A)}
       & ({(simple,#23(A)),#24(A)}
           & ({[(woman>singular)?1]?1,#25(A)}
               & ({(member,#24(A)),B}
                   => [([love, {dobj,#25(A)}, {subject,A}]?1),
                       B])))))

to

man?-1(A) => woman?1(#25(A)) & love?1(A, #25(A))?1

Then you would want to be able to use that along with

butler < man and love < like

and 

butler(John) 

to prove woman?1(#25(John)) & like?1(John, #25(John))?1

So I *think* it's coming out how we want it, but we'll have to check
in Satchmo.
