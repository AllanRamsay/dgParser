The transformations are now in nf.pl. They're pretty much the same
things as before, just slightly reorganised to take account of the
changes to the parse trees. Some of them can be turned on and off by
setting/unsetting the appropriate flags. I would look at what happens
when you do

| ?- set(fixContexts).

and 

| ?- unset(fixContexts).

The others are mainly to do with equality, but I don't like what I've
been doing with equality so I'd ignore them.

You can make it print out the various steps during normal-forming by
doing

| ?- set(printing).

The main ways to call it are 

| ?- latexParse('every accountant is a bookkeeper .').

nfTree([.,
        arg(claim,
            *(tense(present, -)),
            [be,
             arg(predication(xbar(v(-), n(+))),
                 *(indefinite),
                 [bookkeeper>]),
             arg(subject, *(universal), [accountant>])])])

(if you do | ?- set(latex) then the tree also gets printed in a
LaTeXable form)

and 

| ?- nfParse('every accountant is a bookkeeper .').

claim((now=#0
        & at(#0,
             (accountant(A)
               => (bookkeeper(#2(A))
                    & (be(#1)
                        & (predication(#1, #2(A), xbar(v(-), n(+)))
                            & subject(#1, A))))))))
