setProblem((t & (s & (m=>like:-1)))=>absurd).

prove((t & (s & (m => love:-1)))=>absurd).

To prove (t & (s & (m => love:-1)))=>absurd I assert (t & (s & (m =>
love:-1))) and try to prove absurd.

(t & (s & (m=>like:-1)))=>absurd
(t & (s & (m => love:-1)): this bit should have turned into
t
s
(m => love:-1)

To prove absurd, I have to prove (t & (s & (m=>like:-1)))

To prove (t & (s & (m=>like:-1))) we have to prove t and prove s and prove (m=>like:-1).

Proving t and proving s isn't difficult given what's in the database

To prove (m => like:-1) we assert m and try to prove like:-1.

Will we get the right match between love:-1 and like:-1?

John does not like Mary => John does not love Mary
((John likes Mary) => absurd) => ((John loves Mary) => absurd))

abstracting

(JLIKESM => A) => (JLOVESM => A)

(P => A) => (P' => A) if (P' => P)

So we need to get the polarity so it says that!
